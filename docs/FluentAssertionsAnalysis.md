## Analysis Summary

After reviewing the original FluentAssertions source code and comparing it with our implementation:

1. Core Assertions Match: Our implementation correctly matches the core assertion methods from FluentAssertions
2. Method Signatures: The method signatures and return types align with the original implementation
3. Chaining Support: We maintain the fluent interface pattern with proper chaining support
4. Shouldly Integration: Each assertion properly delegates to the corresponding Shouldly assertion

### Recommendations

1. Continue maintaining strict parity with FluentAssertions API
2. Document any intentional deviations from FluentAssertions behavior
3. Keep this analysis document updated as new assertions are added or modified
4. Add test coverage for any missing assertion scenarios

### Next Steps

1. Regular validation against new FluentAssertions releases
2. Update test coverage based on FluentAssertions test suite
3. Document any Shouldly-specific behavior differences
